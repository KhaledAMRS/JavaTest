/*
What's Class?
- Class is a template used to create objects and to define object data types and methods.
- you could create different number of objects from the same class.
- For example: in the real world, “human being” is a template (class)
    and there are different objects (men/women) from this class.
*/

/*
what are java classes consist of?
- Java classes consist of variables (characteristics) and methods (behaviors)
- for example: human being (classes) share some characteristics from the same template
like hands, legs, head, eyes, etc & behaviors like eating, sleeping, walking and talking
*/

/*
- let's see how to define class in java
  Access_Modifiers class ClassName {}

- Example: Access_Modifiers = public     class=class    ClassName = anyName
  public class anyName {}

- Note: Java is case sensitive, for example 'public' should not be 'Public'
same thing with 'class' it should not be 'Class'
*/

/*
- What's public and what's other types of Access_Modifiers available for class
  1- Default: the class will be available for any other class in the same package
     but not available for other packages
  2- public: declared public can be accessed from any other class.

  Note: there might be other Access_Modifiers for class but that's enough for now
